# Chatbot de Turismo


This project is a tourism chatbot developed in TypeScript using Express.js, LangChain, LangGraph, and Vite. The chatbot interacts with various external APIs to provide information on weather, hotels, flights, and tourist activities. Additionally, it manages user conversations through a thread and memory system, utilizing specialized agents for each task.

Note: When using Amadeus, there are locations where the hotel database is not up-to-date, which may result in the hotel section being empty.

Key Features
Weather Query: Retrieves weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Hotel Availability: Checks hotel availability using the Amadeus API.

Flight Search: Searches for flights using the Amadeus API.

Tourist Activities: Suggests tourist activities based on the city and budget, integrating links to Civitatis for complete options.

Conversation Management: Maintains a conversation history per user using a thread system and LangChain agents.

Specialized Agents: Utilizes LangChain agents to handle specific tasks such as flight search, hotel search, and weather queries.

Frontend with Vite: The frontend is developed with Vite, a modern tool that offers superior performance and a faster development experience.

APIs Used
OpenWeatherMap: For obtaining weather information.

Documentation: OpenWeatherMap

Amadeus: For checking hotel availability and flight searches.

Documentation: Amadeus

Civitatis: For obtaining tourist activities and tours.

Documentation: Civitatis

OpenAI: For generating natural language tools.

Documentation: OpenAI

Makcorps: For obtaining city codes.

Documentation: Makcorps

Choice of Amadeus over Makcorps
The choice of Amadeus over Makcorps is due to Amadeus offering a more complete and robust API for flight and hotel searches. Makcorps only allows about 10 test calls in its FREE version. For more extensive queries, it becomes a paid service at $350 per month for 10k free calls per month. Therefore, this example is implemented using Amadeus, which, although not updated in some locations, is more accessible for this project.

Use of LangChain and LangGraph
LangChain
LangChain is used to manage the logic of the agents and the interaction with external APIs. The agents are responsible for handling specific tasks such as flight search, hotel search, and weather queries. Each agent is designed to interact with a specific API and return structured results.

LangGraph
LangGraph is used to manage the flow of conversations and user memory. It allows maintaining a history of interactions per user and efficiently managing conversation threads.

Agents
Weather Agent: Interacts with OpenWeatherMap to obtain weather information.

Hotel Agent: Interacts with the Amadeus API to check hotel availability.

Flight Agent: Interacts with the Amadeus API to search for flights.

Activity Agent: Suggests tourist activities based on the city and budget, integrating links to Civitatis.

Architecture
The project follows a modular, layered architecture:

Routing Layer: Defines the API endpoints (index.ts and routes/chat.ts).

Controller Layer: Handles business logic and interactions with LangChain agents.

Agent Layer: Contains specialized agents that interact with external APIs (agents/WeatherAgent.ts, agents/HotelAgent.ts, etc.).

Utility Layer: Helper functions for handling data and additional logic (utils/extracTravelinfo.ts, utils/process_messages.ts).

Memory Layer: Manages conversation state through threads and LangGraph (utils/manejo_hilos.ts).

Frontend with Vite
The frontend of this project is developed with Vite, allowing for a fast and efficient development experience. Below is the interaction flow with the chatbot from the frontend:

Data Input:

The user enters the origin, destination, start date, and return date in the chatbot interface.

This data is sent to the backend via an HTTP request.

Backend Processing:

The backend processes the request, queries the corresponding APIs (weather, flights, hotels), and generates a structured response.

Result Display:

The frontend receives the response from the backend and displays it to the user in a clear and organized manner.

Weather data, extra tips, outbound and return flights, available hotels, and a link to tourist activities on Civitatis are shown.

Choice of Amadeus over Makcorps
The choice of Amadeus over Makcorps is due to Amadeus offering a more complete and robust API for flight and hotel searches, with more detailed documentation and broader support. Additionally, Amadeus is one of the leading booking platforms in the travel industry, ensuring greater accuracy and data availability.
